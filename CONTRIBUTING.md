# 👥 Contributing to `d-clare/specification`

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the [DClare Specification](https://github.com/d-clare/sdk-net) — we’re building a composable, expressive agentic orchestration framework for the future of AI workflows.

Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or implementing new capabilities — we appreciate your help!

## 🧠 Guidelines

### ✅ Do

- Use clear, self-explanatory commit messages
- Follow C# conventions
- Add or update unit/integration tests when applicable
- Write or improve XML `<summary>` docs for public types and members

### ❌ Don’t

- Introduce breaking changes without discussion
- Leave `TODO` comments in committed code
- Reformat unrelated files in the same PR

---

## 💡 Feature Contributions

1. Open an issue or discussion to validate your idea
2. Fork and branch from `main`
3. Create a descriptive PR — include context, screenshots, YAML examples if relevant

---

## 🧪 Testing

All PRs must pass unit tests and schema validation. We're actively adding more test coverage — feel free to contribute!

---

## 📚 Documentation

Public APIs, YAML schemas, and DSL syntax should be documented in:

- XML comments (`<summary>`, etc.)
- Markdown files in `/docs`
- Example YAML snippets under `/samples`

## Abstract

This document provides formal definitions and detailed property references for all components described in the DClare Domain-Specific Language (DSL). It serves as a comprehensive technical guide for authors, developers, and system integrators working with DClare-based agentic architectures.

By exploring this reference, users will gain a clear and structured understanding of how to define, configure, and interconnect the various declarative components of DClare â€” including agents, kernels, kernel functions, processes, communication channels, memory providers, toolsets, and authentication blocks.

This document complements the DSL overview and is intended as a precise specification for implementation, validation, tooling support, and schema generation. It enables accurate modeling of agentic systems and fosters interoperability across runtimes and platforms that support the DClare ecosystem.

## Definitions

The following sections define the core elements of the DClare DSL and their associated properties. Each definition represents a building block of an agentic system, designed to be modular, declarative, and extensible.

Each component is presented with a summary of its purpose, a table of available properties, their expected types, descriptions, and whether they are required or optional. These definitions form the foundation of any valid DClare manifest and should be used as the authoritative source when authoring or validating component configurations.

Unless otherwise noted, all definitions are designed to be serialized in YAML or JSON and follow consistent naming and structural conventions throughout the DClare ecosystem.
